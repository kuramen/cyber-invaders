Finally, we will proceed to the public mint which will allow to complete our ranks. The Cyber Invasion will then begin.",

      "In a few words, you will have three different paths. Your goal will be to get an NFT from a piece of the ship that will allow you to leave your planet and invade the Solana blockchain. Don't panic, you will be able to mine an NFT to complete the missions of the 2 other paths or directly mine the final NFT from the piece of the ship.",
      "Once the 3 pieces are recovered, you will be able to burn these 3 NFTs and get a modified version of your NFT. This one will be part of an alternative and mutated collection of your NFTs. You will know more about it later.",
